# Elus C# Goodie bag
Random bits of code im throwing together for various things. 

You can look in and take what you like! I think its all free anyway.

I'll be adding more to it all as a create junk.

To use the various bits and bobs, start by adding "using ElusGoodies;" to the top of your cs file.

If the code you want to use is in a folder, you instead add "using ElusGoodies.$FOLDER NAME$;"

Hopefully you get some good use out of it!

Contiains:
Recreations of various lists and collections types that I wanted to try to recreate for the fun of it.
Vector2/3 classes that have operators (can subtract , multiply, divide, etc).
Some Bitmap stuff for quick bitmap reading(anyone can do this one, its really easy lol)
Some Code for getting random numbers really quick.
Some other stuff im working on right now!
