# Elus C# Goodie bag
Random bits of code im throwing together for various things. 

You can look in and take what you like! I think its all free anyway.

I'll be adding more to it all as a create junk.

To use the various bits and bobs, start by adding "using ElusGoodies;" to the top of your cs file.

If the code you want to use is in a folder, you instead add "using ElusGoodies.$FOLDER NAME$;"

Hopefully you get some good use out of it!
